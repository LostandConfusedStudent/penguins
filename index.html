    <h1>Penguins</h1>
    <p>Penguins are birds that cannot fly. Most species live in Antarcica, including: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Emperor</li>
        <li>Chinstrap</li>
        <li>Gentoo</li>
    </ul>
    <p>They usually move around by waddling and hopping. They can also slide on their bellies</p>
    <p>Of course, it is very cold in antarctica and these little guys will need to be able to defend themselves. They huddle together to protect themselves from predators and the cold.</p>
